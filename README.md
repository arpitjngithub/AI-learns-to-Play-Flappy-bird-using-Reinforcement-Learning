In this repository I implemented Deep Q-Netowrk (DQN) which is a value-based deep reinforcement learning algorithm in the flappy bird environment which is made using pygame.

I trained the model for around 40 hours and on running after it bird is able to fly itself and scoring and avg of 20-25 points.
On training further and by tuning hyperparameters we can increase its performance further.

I have done this project under the Summer of Code 2024  organized by Web and Coding Club IIT Bombay in my 2nd year of Aerospace Engineering at IIT Bombay.

Any suggestions for further improvement would be appreciated.
